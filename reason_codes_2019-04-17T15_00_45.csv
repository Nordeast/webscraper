the remote LU is a member of a remote sysplex and the local system

sysplex to be accessed must be defined in the local SYSIBM.LULIST

the remote LU in SYSIBM.LULIST, such as when you do not want the remote
LU to be a candidate member when outbound accessing the remote SYSPLEX

the unintended use of a generic LU name, which would make Db2 aware of a partner LU name (its
generic LU name) that is not specified in the LUNAME column of the

00D3111F," The maximum amount of buffered query data has
been exceeded.  Rather than return one block of query data, the DRDA  server system elected to
return multiple extra blocks.  Instead of fetching all rows in all
the extra blocks, the requesting application either executed an SQL
statement that is not related to the query or executed a commit while
a held cursor was still open. Db2 buffers
the extra in-transit blocks, however Db2 was
not able to buffer the entire set of extra blocks and thus truncated
the result set.  The application then resumed fetching and attempted
to fetch data beyond the point of truncation. 
This
SQLCODE can also be returned when the DRDA server
system calculates the maximum amount of storage required for processing
query data, and finds  the requested storage exceeds the system limit. 
"," The SQL statement fails.
"," Notify the system programmer.
"," Determine the failing application
program and consider the following resolutions:  
The cursor definition may cause the server to return extra blocks.
In this case, the cursor definition can be changed to reduce the number
of rows, thus extra blocks, being returned by the server.  Db2 for z/OS systems
return extra blocks for cursors defined with the OPTIMIZER
FOR n rows clause and will return only enough extra
blocks in order to return n rows. When a cursor
is defined with OPTIMIZER FOR n rows, either
in the application or in a stored procedure, this indicates an application
intent to fetch all n rows before attempting to
execute other SQL statements. The application is not abiding by its
intent and is executing other SQL, or committing, prior to fetching
all n rows. In this case, the cursor definition
can be changed to reduce the value of n, or the
application logic can be modified to fetch all n rows
or to close the cursor before executing the statement that caused
the in-transit data to be buffered.

The number of extra blocks returned can be controlled by Db2 installation parameters. The
maximum number of extra blocks requested by a Db2 requester system is determined by the ""Extra
Blocks Req"" option of the DSNTIP5 Db2 installation
panel. This value can be reduced which prevents the server system
from returning more blocks than the Db2 requester
system can buffer.  Similarly, the server system may also provide
a method to regulate the maximum number of extra blocks that it will
return to a  requester. In this case, this number can also be reduced. For Db2 for z/OS systems,
this is determined by the EXTRA BLOCKS SRV field on the DSNTIP5 Db2 installation panel. 
Examine the columns in the cursor select list. The
columns in the select list can impact the amount of storage required
by the DRDA server for processing
query data. The cursor definition can be changed to reduce the number
of columns in the select list, or the columns in the select list can
be changed to have a smaller declared length in the table. Both can
reduce the required storage at the DRDA server
to handle the query data.

Make configuration changes to refer to only IPv4 addresses.


To configure TCP/IP to support IPv6 addressing, you must
first ensure that TCP/IP is configured to use a dual-mode IPv4 and
IPv6 stack - the BPXPRMxx PARMLIB member must be modified to allow
TCP/IP to behave as a dual-mode stack. Other TCP/IP configuration
changes are also required to define the IPv6 address. You can verify
that IPv6 addressing is correctly defined for Db2 purposes if the Db2 Display
DDF command report, issued after DDF is started, provides an IPv6
address. 
If TCP/IP cannot be configured to support IPv6 addressing,
you can only refer to IPv4 addresses. If the IPADDR column, of the

","Db2 issues message DSNT772I.
The
subsequent system action depends on the ATTRIBUTE1 column value in the SYSIBM.DSN_PROFILE_ATTRIBUTES
table:
If the ATTRIBUTE1 value is EXCEPTION, Db2 abnormally terminates the execution unit, terminates the server thread to release resources that
might affect other threads, and terminates the connection with the remote application. 
If the ATTRIBUTE1 value is EXCEPTION_ROLLBACK, the server thread is aborted. The connection with
the remote application is maintained.If the aborted transaction performed database updates, the
application environment is placed in a must-abort state so that the application environment is made
aware of the resources that have been destroyed as a result of the aborted threads. 
Important If either of the following situations are true, Db2 hides the EXCEPTION_ROLLBACK event from the
remote application environment:The aborted transaction performed only read-only operations.
The transaction committed or aborted, but the associated database access thread remained active
before it became idle.

Because the EXCEPTION_ROLLBACK event is not visible to the remote application environment in
those cases, it might appear to the remote application environment that the database resources are
unexpectedly disappearing. For example, held cursors, kept dynamic statements, and declared
temporary tables that were created in the transaction are destroyed. Use EXCEPTION_ROLLBACK only if
the remote application environment can account for this apparent loss of database
resources.



","Notify the system programmer. 
","Review the information provided in message DSNT772I. Determine why the
requesting application did not make a request to the Db2 server in the specified time. 
This condition typically occurs for one of the following reasons:
The ACTIVE thread option was specified in the DDF THREADS field of the DSNTIPR installation
panel, and a requester application or its user did not make a request to the Db2 server for an extended period (such as a lengthy
user absence). As a result, the server thread becomes susceptible to cancellation because of the
timeout value. Action: Determine why the requesting application did not make a request to
the Db2 server in the specified time.

The INACTIVE thread option was specified in the DDF THREADS field of the DSNTIPR installation
panel, and a requester application or its user failed to commit before an extended dormant period
(such as user absence). It is also possible that, despite committing before an extended dormant
period, database resources are still held because of other existing conditions. As a result, the
server thread cannot be moved to the inactive state and becomes susceptible to being canceled
because of the timeout value.Action: Determine why the server thread was not moved to the
inactive state.

reason code. A record is written to SYS1.LOGREC.  No SVC dump is taken.
",," Some possible reasons why IRLM could
not join its data sharing group are:  The lock structure is not properly defined in the active MVS CFRM administrative policy. The
lock structure name is a concatenation of the Db2 data sharing group name and the string 'LOCK1',
separated by an underscore (_). For example, if the Db2 data sharing group name is DSNCAT, DSNCAT_LOCK1
would be the lock structure name.  Ensure that the lock structure
is properly defined in the active MVS CFRM
policy.  The name of the lock structure that IRLM attempted to access
is given in message DSNT800I. IRLM issues message DXR138E to indicate
that the lock structure definition could not be accessed in the active MVS CFRM policy.

IRLM could not connect the lock structure. The reason for the
connect failure is given in IRLM message DXR135E.
IRLM could not join its data sharing group. The reason for the
join failure is given in IRLM message DXR134E.
IRLM joined the wrong group.  The set of IRLMs that are connected
to a given lock structure must all be members of the same group.  Ensure
that the GROUP parameter is correctly specified in the IRLM startup
procedure. If you give an incorrect group name, IRLM connects the
lock structure, and then times out waiting for responses from other
connectors.  IRLM issues message DXR133I for the timeout.

the data provided by the DSNWRCRD service. If DSN9SCN9 records a failure in
SYS1.LOGREC and the reason code in the VRA is not of the form X'00F9xxxx',
the reason code is changed to X'00F90009'. This is done so that anyone examining
a SYS1.LOGREC entry can determine, from the reason code, what additional data
has been placed in the VRA. The reason code is the first data item in the
