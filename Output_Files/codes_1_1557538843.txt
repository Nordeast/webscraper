  -159 THE STATEMENT REFERENCES object-name WHICH IDENTIFIES AN actual-type
  RATHER THAN AN expected-type

Explanation
  An object was specified as part of a statement, but the actual type of the
  object is not the expected type. For example, if the statement is DROP ALIAS
  TED.T1, then TED.T1 must be an alias name.
    object-name
      - The name of the object.
      actual-type
      - The current type of the object.
      expected-type
      - The expected type of the object.
      If actual-type or expected-type is TABLE, and actual-type or expected-type
      is a particular type of table, then the type of table was not valid for
      the statement that was specified.

System Action
  The statement cannot be processed.

Programmer Response
  Change the statement to match the type of object that is identified by the
  expected-type value. For example:
    - An ALTER VIEW statement must reference an existing view.
      - A COMMENT ON ALIAS statement must specify the name of an alias, and not
      the name of a table or view.
      - A COMMENT ON TABLE statement must reference an existing table or view.
      - A CREATE INDEX statement with the UNIQUE keyword must specify a table
      that is not a materialized query table.
      - A CREATE INDEX statement must specify the name of a table that is not a
      clone table.
      - A CREATE TRIGGER statement must specify a table in the ON clause that is
      not a materialized query table. That is, a trigger cannot be defined for a
      materialized query table.
      - A CREATE TRIGGER statement must specify the name of a table that is not
      a clone table.
      - A DROP ALIAS statement must specify the name of an alias, and not the
      name of a table or view.
      - A DROP TABLE statement must reference an existing table. If an alias is
      specified, then the table that the alias refers to is dropped. Use the
      DROP ALIAS statement to drop the alias.
      - A DROP VIEW statement must reference an existing view.
      - A REFRESH TABLE statement must refer to a materialized query table.
      - A CREATE MASK or CREATE PERMISSION statement must name a base table that
      exists on the server. The table must not be a system-period temporal
      table, a history table, or an accelerator-only table.
      - The table-locator-reference must reference a table name in the LIKE
      clause.
