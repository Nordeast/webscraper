explanation
    div: The string constant beginning with

    div > ul > li: For a hexadecimal constant (X, GX, or UX), the number of hexadecimal digits must not exceed 32704.

    div > ul > li: Any other graphic string constant must be short enough so that its UTF-8 representation requires no more than 32704 bytes.
    div > ul > li: The sum of the lengths of the UTF-8 representations of the constant values in an ENDING AT clause must not exceed 765 bytes. This clause applies to CREATE TABLE, ALTER TABLE, CREATE INDEX, or ALTER INDEX.
    div: In some contexts, however, the limit is smaller.
    p: For special registers, the allowable length depends on the particular special register. A string that exceeds the limit can be specified only through assignment from a host variable.

explanation
    div: To determine the subtype of an input host variable or result column, the SYSSTRINGS catalog table was accessed with the specified CCSID and, one of the following error conditions occurred:
    div > ul > li: The CCSID is not a value of either INCCSID or OUTCCSID.
    div > ul > li: The TRANSTYPE column classifies the CCSID as GRAPHIC rather than CHARACTER.
    div > ul > li: A graphic CCSID has not been specified on your system.
    div > ul > li: The CCSID is outside the acceptable range of values. The CCSID must be between 1 and 65533, inclusive, or the value 65535.
    div > ul > li: A DBCS CCSID was specified when casting to CHAR, VARCHAR or CLOB.
    div > ul > li: An SBCS or mixed CCSID, or 65535 was specified when casting to a graphic data type.
    div > ul > li: CCSID 65535, which is valid only for data with the FOR BIT DATA attribute, was specified when casting to a CLOB.
    p: This error can occur when SYSSTRINGS is accessed with a pair of CCSIDs to determine if a translation is defined for the pair. In this case, the error is the inconsistency between the data type of a string and the TRANSTYPE classification of its CCSID (one is GRAPHIC and the other is CHARACTER).
    p: This error can also occur when a CCSID specified in DECP does not exist as a value in the INCCSID or OUTCCSID columns of SYSSTRINGS.
    p: Another reason this error can occur is that you may be using one of the graphic built-in functions but a graphic CCSID was not specified during system installation.

explanation
    div: A clause was not valid for one of the following reasons:
    div > ul > li: The cursor,
    div > ul > li > var: cursor-name
    div > ul > li: , is defined as SENSITIVE, but the content of the SELECT statement makes the cursor read-only. In most cases the SELECT statement requires
    div > ul > li > span: Db2®

    div > ul > li > span: Db2
    div > ul > li: cannot guarantee that changes made outside the cursor will be visible. In this case, the cursor must be defined INSENSITIVE or ASENSITIVE.
    div > ul > li: The cursor,

    : IN A REFERENCE TO FUNCTION
    var: function-name
    : BY SIGNATURE, A MATCHING FUNCTION COULD NOT BE FOUND
explanation
    p: In a reference to function
    p > var: function-name
    p: by signature, no matching function could be found. The problem could be with the data type or some other attributes of a parameter. For some data types there are attributes in addition to data type:
    ul > li: Length, precision, or scale
    ul > li > p: While it is not necessary to specify a length, precision, or scale attribute for a data type, if one is specified then there must be an exact match on the corresponding specification of the parameter for the existing function as defined in SYSPARMS.
    ul > li > p: A type of FLOAT(n) does not need to match the defined value for n since 1<=n<=21 means REAL and 22<=n<=53 means DOUBLE. Matching occurs based on whether the type is REAL or DOUBLE.
    ul > li > p: However, a match on data type is sufficient.
    ul > li > p: To indicate this, an empty set of parentheses must be specified for the data types that allow a specification of length, precision, or scale. For example, assuming a function exists for which a parameter was defined as CHAR(12) on the CREATE FUNCTION statement, a reference to that function by a signature could specify this parameter as either CHAR(12), or CHAR(). The CHAR() syntax provides a way to say, "do not care about length, precision and scale attributes in finding a matching function".
    ul > li > p: FLOAT() cannot be used since the parameter value indicates different data types (REAL or DOUBLE).
    ul > li > p: If, however, neither length, precision, scale, or empty parenthesis were specified, then normal default rules apply. For example, a specification of CHAR would result in CHAR(1) as on the CREATE TABLE statement. Furthermore, this implicit specification of length, precision, or scale must exactly match the corresponding specification of the parameter for the existing function as defined in SYSPARMS.
    ul > li: Subtype, or encoding scheme
    ul > li > p: You do not need to specify the subtype or encoding scheme (CCSID clause) to identify an existing function in the database. However, if a subtype or encoding scheme is specified then there must be an exact match on the corresponding specification of the parameter for the existing function as defined in SYSPARMS.
    p: Unqualified function names:
    ul > li: For ALTER FUNCTION, DROP FUNCTION, COMMENT ON FUNCTION, GRANT and REVOKE statements for EXECUTE on functions, an unqualified function name is implicitly qualified with the default schema, and this is the schema where the function with the problem can be found.
    ul > li: In the SOURCE clause of a CREATE FUNCTION statement, the qualification comes from the SQL path. In this case,
    ul > li > span: Db2®
    ul > li: could not resolve the invocation of a function using the schemas in the user's SQL path. For details, see

    : A USER DEFINED DATA TYPE CANNOT BE CALLED THE SAME NAME AS A SYSTEM PREDEFINED TYPE (BUILT-IN TYPE)
explanation
    div: The name of a data type to be created has an unqualified name that is the same as a system-predefined data type. The name that you specified is not allowed. Adding delimiters does not make the name valid. The following names are restricted:

    : REFERENCE TO FUNCTION

explanation
    p: References to a function without a signature are permitted, but the named function
    p > var: function-name
    p: must be unique in its schema and it is not.
    p: Note also that in the ALTER FUNCTION, DROP FUNCTION, COMMENT ON FUNCTION, GRANT and REVOKE statements for EXECUTE on functions, an unqualified reference is qualified with the default schema, and this is the schema where the problem can be found. In the SOURCE clause of a CREATE FUNCTION statement, the qualification comes from the SQL path. In this case, the first schema in the path containing a function with this name had other functions by the same name.

    : THE INSERT OR UPDATE VALUE OF FOREIGN KEY

explanation
    p: An insert or update operation attempted to place a value in a foreign key of the object table; however, this value was not equal to some value of the parent key of the parent table.
    p: When a row is inserted into a dependent table, the insert value of a foreign key must be equal to the value of the parent key of some row of the parent table in the associated relationship.
    p: When the value of the foreign key is updated, the update value of a foreign key must be equal to the value of the parent key of some row of the parent table of the associated relationship.
    div: The following additional rules apply for a temporal referential constraint:
    div > ul > li: When a row is inserted into a dependent table, the BUSINESS_TIME value in the child table must be contained in a BUSINESS_TIME period in the parent table that is represented by the union of BUSINESS_TIME periods of one or more contiguous matching rows in the parent table.
    div > ul > li: When the value of the foreign key is updated, the update value of the foreign key must be contained in a BUSINESS_TIME period in the parent table that is represented by the union of BUSINESS_TIME periods of one or more contiguous matching rows in the parent table.

    : THE STATEMENT WOULD RESULT IN A MULTIPLE SITE UPDATE
explanation
    div: This SQLCODE is issued in the following situations:
    div > ul > li: When an application program operating in an IMS™ or CICS® environment attempts to modify data at a remote location where multi-site update capabilities are not supported.
    div > ul > li: When an application program has explicit SQL statements within a commit scope that would result in updates at multiple sites where one of the sites at which data is being updated does not support multi-site update.
    div: This SQLCODE can be issued when an application program explicitly modifies data at a single location within a commit scope. This can occur in the following situations:
    div > ul > li > span: A package that is associated with the application program was invalidated.
    div > ul > li: A package or plan was bound at one release of
    div > ul > li > span: Db2®
    div > ul > li: and fallback occurs to a prior release.
    div: In the situations described above, an implicit autobind is done on behalf of the user. An autobind results in the
    div > span: Db2
    div: catalog being updated. The conditions that must exist for this SQLCODE to be issued when an autobind occurs are:
    div > ul > li: One site where data has been modified does not support multi-site update.
    div > ul > li: The autobind occurs at a separate and distinct site from where an application program explicitly modifies data.

    ul > li: Either the USER, or SESSION_USER, or CURRENT SQLID special register is specified and the length attribute of the character string column is not sufficient to store a value that is 8 characters when the value is expressed in CCSID 37.
    ul > li: A system-generated cast function was specified and the column is not defined with a user-defined distinct type.
    ul > li: A function was specified that is not supported. A function can be specified only when the data type is a distinct type, and in this case the specified function must be one of the system-generated cast functions associated with this distinct type.
    ul > li: A value with non-zero scale was specified for the START WITH or INCREMENT BY option of an identity column with the DECIMAL data type.
    ul > li: A decimal floating point (DECFLOAT) constant is specified. A decimal floating point cannot be restricted to zero scale numbers and, as such, may not be used in IDENTITY columns.
    ul > li: WITH DEFAULT is specified using a value other than NULL for a LOB column without INLINE LENGTH attribute.

    div: The current environment does not allow SQL statements that read data. One of the following situations had occurred:
    div > ul > li: A user-defined function or stored procedure
    div > ul > li > var: object-name
    div > ul > li: was invoked and attempted to read data, but the function or procedure was defined without the READS SQL DATA or MODIFIES SQL DATA option.
    div > ul > li: A function or procedure defined with CONTAINS SQL or NO SQL has attempted to invoke another function or procedure defined with READS SQL DATA.
    p: In an environment of nested functions and procedures, the SQL option in effect is the most restrictive one that has been specified in the nested hierarchy of functions and procedures. The SQL data access option in effect does not allow for reading data.
system_action
    p: The SQL statement failed.

explanation
    div: There is a CASE expression in the statement that has
    div > em: result-expressions
    div: (expressions following THEN and ELSE keywords) that are not compatible. The data type of the
    div > em: result-expressions
    div: might be incompatible because the CASE condition result data types are not all:
    div > ul > li: character

    div > ul > li: date
    div > ul > li: time
    div > ul > li: timestamp
    div > ul > li: binary string
    div > ul > li: user-defined type
    p: If encoded in Unicode, character and graphic data types are compatible, however.
    p: An array value with a user-defined array type can be assigned only to an array variable that is defined as the same user-defined array type. The rules for assigning an array value without a user-defined array type to an array variable depend on the statement that specifies the assignment. See

    span: THE PRIMARY KEY OR A HASH KEY OR A UNIQUE CONSTRAINT IS TOO LONG OR HAS TOO MANY COLUMNS AND PERIODS
explanation
    p: The number of columns and periods that are defined for a PRIMARY KEY or UNIQUE constraint is too large. Both of the following conditions must be met:
    ul > li: The total of the number of columns and two times the number of identified periods must not exceed 64.

explanation
    div: The

    div > ul > li: If

The definition for the cluster index for a partitioned table must contain exactly as many partition specifications as there are partitions in the table space in which that table resides. Also, the partition numbers must be valid and unique.
    div > ul > li: If

    : THE RECORD LENGTH OF THE TABLE EXCEEDS THE PAGE SIZE LIMIT
explanation
    p: The row length for a table cannot exceed the page size of the table space in which that table resides (or is to reside). The page size of the table space is determined by the buffer pool used by that table space. This error can result from one of the following conditions:
    dl > dt: Cast specification
    dl > dd: The target length exceeds the maximum limit. The limit is 32764 for a varying length character string result.
    dl > dt: Table creation
    dl > dd: The following conditions are possible for a CREATE TABLE statement:
    dl > dd > ul > li: As defined in a CREATE TABLE statement, the row length for the table would exceed the page size of the specified (or default) table space. To correct this situation, either:
    dl > dd > ul > li > ul > li: Reduce the row length of the table by reducing the length of one or more of the columns.
    dl > dd > ul > li > ul > li: Assign the table to a table space that uses a larger buffer pool.
    dl > dd > ul > li: The LOB column with INLINE LENGTH clause has contributed to exceeding the page size limit.
    dl > dt: Table alteration
    dl > dd: The following conditions are possible for an ALTER TABLE statement:
    dl > dd > ul > li: Addition of the specified column would cause the row length of the table to exceed the page size of the table space. This table cannot be altered to add columns.
    dl > dd > ul > li: The statement was issued to alter the length of an existing variable-length column and the new length of the altered column would cause the row length of the table to exceed the page size of the table space.
    dl > dd > ul > li: The LOB column with an INLINE LENGTH clause has contributed to exceeding the page size limit.
    dl > dd > p: To correct this situation, reduce the length of the column.
    dl > dt: Table space alteration
    dl > dd: In the case of an ALTER TABLESPACE statement that is used to alter the buffer pool to a smaller page size, the row length for one of the tables in the table space exceeds the new smaller page size.
    dl > dt: Join result
    dl > dd: The row length in the result of a join exceeds the maximum limit.
    dl > dd > span: The limit is 65,529 bytes
    dl > dd: The sort record includes columns that are being sorted and columns that the user selects. The length of the columns that the user selects is the sort data length.
    dl > dt: Sort result

The version specified for the precompile already exists in the catalog. The combination of 'location.collection.package.version' must be unique in the SYSIBM.SYSPACKAGE catalog table. A common mistake is that the user may believe that the version he is creating is the one specified in the REPLVER keyword. This is not the case. The version specified in the REPLVER keyword is the name of the version being replaced. The version that will be created is the version that was given to the program when it was precompiled.

explanation
    p: Cascading of indirect SQL occurs when a trigger, user-defined function or stored procedure invokes another trigger, user-defined function or stored procedure which in turn invokes another. The activation of some of the triggers in this chain might be due to the enforcement of referential constraint delete rules. The depth of this cascading is limited to 16.
    div: Note that recursive situations where a trigger includes a triggered SQL statement that directly or indirectly causes the same trigger to be activated are very likely to cause this error. The trigger should contain logic to check for a terminating condition to prevent this error.
    div > dl > dt > var: object-type

    p: If the index space is an XML index, the duplicate values can be caused by the values in the XML document or by the result of data type conversion and rounding.
    p: Otherwise, a primary key, unique constraint, or unique index exists over one or more columns of the table. The operation cannot be performed because one or more values would have produced a duplicate key in the unique index or constraint.

    ul > li: The application was precompiled, compiled, and linked, but was not bound.
    ul > li: The application was precompiled and bound, but was not compiled and linked for the application program.

    div > ul > li > p: The unit of work must be terminated by a rollback operation because the update made (but not committed) at the application server cannot be committed consistently with other current or future updates made to this distributed unit of work.
    div > ul > li: An abend occurred during the execution of a stored procedure, or a restricted SQL statement was issued from a stored procedure.
    div > ul > li: An abend occurred during the execution of a function, or a restricted SQL statement was issued from a function.
    div > ul > li: The unit of work is part of a Global Transaction, and another unit of work in the Global Transaction has initiated a ROLLBACK. All units of work in the Global Transaction must now ROLLBACK.

    p: Deployment is the process of establishing an SQL routine at a remote location without regenerating the representation of that routine. The deployment requires that the remote server be able to understand the structures generated by the current server for the identified package. The difference in code level between the current server and the remote location makes this impossible. The difference might be in release levels or maintenance levels, but it is large enough that the package cannot be deployed from the current server to the remote location.

    : INVALID TABLE REFERENCE FOR TABLE LOCATOR
explanation
    p: At execution time, an SQL statement in the body of a routine has a
    p > var: table-locator-reference
    p: in the FROM clause to reference a transition table of the trigger invoking the routine. For example:
    pre > code: TABLE (

    pre > code > var: table-name
    pre > code: )
    p: SQLCODE
    p > span: -4735
    p: is issued when the definition of the table that follows the LIKE keyword is different than the definition of the table specified for the table locator parameter on the CREATE PROCEDURE or CREATE FUNCTION statement for the routine.
    p: The use of TABLE LIKE syntax provides an implicit definition of the transition table. It specifies that the transition table has the same number of columns as the identified table or view. The columns must have the same data type, length, precision, scale, subtype, and encoding scheme as the identified table or view, as described in catalog tables SYSCOLUMNS and SYSTABLESPACES. The number of columns and the attributes of those columns are determined at the time the CREATE PROCEDURE or CREATE FUNCTION statement is processed. Any subsequent changes to the number of columns in the table or the attributes of those columns does not affect the parameters of the routine.

    div > dl > dt: 6
    div > dl > dd: The pattern expression does not have a name test or kind test following the '/'.
    div > dl > dt: 7
    div > dl > dd: The pattern expression uses an unsupported axis in an axis step. Only forward axes child, attribute, descendant, self and descendant-or-self are supported.

    div > dl > dd: The pattern expression specifies an invalid kind test or some syntax that is not a valid name test or kind test supported in a pattern expression.

    div > dl > dd: If the index is intended as a key for XML data, ensure that only one column defined with a data type of XML is specified. Otherwise, remove the XMLPATTERN clause.
    div > dl > dt: 4
    div > dl > dd: Either remove the XMLPATTERN clause or change the specified column to a single column defined with a data type of XML.
    div > dl > dt: 5
    div > dl > dd: Ensure that the pattern expression begins with '/' or '//'. The XQuery syntax for which '/' or '//' is an abbreviation is not supported in the XMLPATTERN clause of the CREATE INDEX statement.
    div > dl > dt: 6
    div > dl > dd: Add a name test or kind test following the '/' in the pattern expression.
    div > dl > dt: 7
    div > dl > dd: Remove any reverse axes from the pattern expression. For example, 'parent::' must not be used as an axes in a pattern expression.
    div > dl > dt: 8
    div > dl > dd: Check the pattern expression for kind tests or name tests that do not match the syntax specification of the XMLPATTERN clause of the CREATE INDEX statement. Correct or remove unsupported syntax.
    div > dl > dt: 9
    div > dl > dd: Remove any predicates from the pattern expression in the XMLPATTERN clause.
    div > dl > dt: 10
    div > dl > dd: Change the pattern expression to remove any syntax that is not valid according to the syntax specification of the XMLPATTERN clause of the CREATE INDEX statement. If the pattern expression includes an asterisk character (*), ensure that the name tests in the pattern expression correctly use the wildcard. If used with a Qname, there must be a colon before or after the wildcard character, otherwise it is considered a multiplication operator. Remove any attempt to use the asterisk as a multiplication operator from the pattern expression. You should also ensure that the XMLPATTERN clause does not include other XQuery operators, XQuery functions or XQuery FLWR (for, let, where, return) expressions.
    div > dl > dt: 11
    div > dl > dd: Reduce the number of steps in the pattern expression. If the value that is to be indexed in the XML documents is longer than 50 steps when the pattern does not contain a function or longer than 44 steps when the pattern does contain a function, the index cannot be created.
    div > dl > dt: 12
    div > dl > dd: Check the argument of the function in the pattern expression that does not conform to the required syntax of the XMLPATTERN clause of the CREATE INDEX statement, and check the index data type. Correct or remove unsupported syntax, or modify the index data type.

explanation
    p: A signaling NaN (sNaN) was encountered in an expression, arithmetic operation, or function. This message could also be issued because an expression, arithmetic operation, or function involving a DECFLOAT column or value resulted in an exception. In either case, the result is a NAN, and an error is issued.

    p: In the case of an INSERT, MERGE, or UPDATE operation, no data is updated or deleted. If the statement is a cursor-controlled FETCH, then the cursor will remain open, unless the exception occurred while processing an aggregate function. If the exception occurred while processing an aggregate function, it is indicated by an operation-type of AGGREGATE FUNCTION. If this is the case, the cursor will be closed. If the cursor is closed, subsequent attempts to use that cursor without first doing an OPEN for it, receive an SQLCODE-501. If the statement was a cursor-controlled OPEN, then the cursor will remain closed.

user_response
    p: Examine the expression which prompted the warning to see if the cause of the problem can be determined. The problem might be data-dependent, in which case you must examine the data that was being processed at the time the error occurred.
    p: If the arithmetic expression in error was within the SELECT list of the outer SELECT statement, then you should include an indicator variable for all expressions in the SELECT list. This allows processing to continue so that non-error column and expression values can be returned.

    p: In an associative array, each element is associated with a unique index value. When the ARRAY_AGG aggregate function is used to construct an array, if more than one element is associated with the same array index value, only one of the element values can be included in the array.

    : EXECUTION FAILED DUE TO A DISTRIBUTION PROTOCOL ERROR THAT CAUSED DEALLOCATION OF THE CONVERSATION: REASON
    var: reason-code (sub-code)
explanation
    p: A DRDA protocol error has occurred that prevented the successful execution of the current SQL statement or command, as well as any subsequent SQL statements.
    p: The 'reason-code' identifies the DDM code point which represents the DDM reply message received from the remote server in response to the attempt to execute the SQL statement. These represent internal errors detected at the remote server site or possibly, by the local
    p > span: Db2®
    p: functions.
    div: The 'reason-code' value is the two-byte hexadecimal code point for the DDM reply message that represents the error and is one of the following:
    div > ul > li > span: X'1232'
    div > ul > li: - AGNPRMRM

    div > ul > li > span: X'124C'
    div > ul > li: - SYNTAXRM
    div: A two byte sub-code accompanies 'reason codes'. The sub-code, when nonzero, consists of two bytes such that the high-order byte indicates the site at which the error was detected. This is
    div > span: X'01'
    div: if the error was detected by the local
    div > span: Db2
    div: ; It is
    div > span: X'02'
    div: if the error was detected by the remote server. The low-order byte is dependent upon the 'reason code' as follows:
    div > ul > li: Description Error Code (DSCERRCD) if reason code=
    div > ul > li > span: X'220A '
    div > ul > li: (DSCINVRM).
    div > ul > li: Syntax Error Code (SYNERRCD) if reason code =

    div > ul > li: 2 (PASSWORD INVALID) -- the password used to connect to the remote server does not match the password stored at the remote server.
    div > ul > li: 3 (PASSWORD MISSING) -- the remote server rejected the connection request because the request did not include a password.
    div > ul > li: 4 (PROTOCOL VIOLATION) -- the remote server rejected the connection request because the request did not contain the proper security information. Error messages or trace records should be produced by the server system to explain the nature of the security violation.
    div > ul > li: 5 (USER-ID MISSING) -- the remote server rejected the connection request because the request did not specify a user-id.
