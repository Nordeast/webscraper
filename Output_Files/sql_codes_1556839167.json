Matching occurs based on whether the type is REAL or DOUBLE.However, a match on data type is sufficient.To indicate this, an empty set of parentheses must be specified for the data types that allow a specification of length, precision, or scale. For example, assuming a function exists for which a parameter was defined as CHAR(12) on the CREATE FUNCTION statement, a reference to that function by a signature could specify this parameter as either CHAR(12), or CHAR(). The CHAR() syntax provides a way to say, \"do not care about length, precision and scale attributes in finding a matching function\".FLOAT() cannot be used since the parameter value indicates different data types (REAL or DOUBLE).If, however, neither length, precision, scale, or empty parenthesis were specified, then normal default rules apply. For example, a specification of CHAR would result in CHAR(1) as on the CREATE TABLE statement.
