    p: An attempt was made to load data into a partition, but the partition is full. Based on the high key value specified in the index for each partition, utilities instructed Data Manager to load a record into the proper partition. This required Data Manager to build a new page with a page number one higher than the last page in the partition. However, this new page is in the next partition.
    p: This situation usually occurs when a very large partition undergoes inserts and updates. When the table space or partition is reorganized, the page set is deleted and redefined, and the free space and PCTFREE cause the partition to expand. It might attempt to fit more data in the partition than the partition can now hold.

    p: stand-alone log services GET and CLOSE processing macro (DSNJSLR) issued this reason code. The stand-alone log services uses a request block to establish communication between itself and the invoking application program. The address to the request block is returned to the application program on a FUNC=OPEN call, and is required for all subsequent stand-alone FUNC=GET and FUNC=CLOSE calls in the RBR parameter. This reason code is returned to the invoking application when the RBR does not address a valid stand-alone request block. Subsequently, the application program's request cannot be processed.

    p: Obtain the SYS1.LOGREC, the SVC memory dump, and the SYSLOG from the time the error occurred. This error is typically caused by a previous error that was recorded on SYS1.LOGREC and produced an SVC memory dump. Examine the SYS1.LOGREC entries and SVC memory dump to determine the primary error that occurred. The SYSLOG might contain messages that describe the error that was encountered.

    p: or RBA or
    p > span: X'00FFFFFFFFFFFF000000'
    p: for LRSN. If the LRSN limit is reached, the BSDS must be converted to the format that supports 10-byte values by using the DSNJCNVT utility. Until this conversion is complete, the subsystem cannot be restarted. If the RBA limit is reached, either the RBA reset procedure can be used or the BSDS can be converted by using DSNJCNVT.

    p: The unit-of-work disposition (commit or rollback) received from a DRDA server is inconsistent with the command sent (commit or rollback), and the SQLCODE returned from the server. For example, if a commit is sent to the server, and the reply message indicates the unit of work (UOW) was committed, but the SQLCODE returned is negative, then this reason code will be contained in the alert sent to NetView®.
system_action
    p: An alert is generated and sent to NetView. Two trace records, IFCID 0191 and IFCID 0193, may be written to the Statistics Class 4 trace, and two DSNL031I messages may be written to the console. The trace records and messages will not be written if this error was previously detected within the last 5 minutes. The Statistics Class 4 trace must be active for the trace records to be written.
    p: An SQLCODE +30100, -30020, or -30030 is returned to the application. An SQLCODE -30020 indicates a rollback was sent to the DRDA server, but a commit unit-of-work disposition was received. An SQLCODE +30100 or -30030 conveys the unit-of-work disposition reported by the server, and replaces the original SQL return code sent by the server, which was not consistent with the UOW disposition. The original SQL return code and SQLSTATE returned by the server are saved as tokens in the SQLCA.

    p: The IFCID 0193 trace record will document the nature of the inconsistency (command sent, UOW disposition received, SQL return code received).
    p: The IFCID 0191 trace record will document the exact data stream returned from the Server. Use this information to determine if the reply message from the server was correctly converted into the UOW disposition and the SQL return code reported in the IFCID 0193 record. If the data stream was correctly converted, then the problem lies at the server and you should contact the system programmer at the server and have him or her analyze the data stream produced by the server.

    p: The requested VTAM® function for allocating a conversation at the
    p > span: Db2®
    p: server was not performed because the requester's LUNAME is not defined in the SYSIBM.LUNAMES table of the communication database (CDB) at the server.
system_action
    p: Notification of the failure is returned to the application. The conversation is not allocated to the specified location.
operator_response
    p: Notify the system programmer.
system_programmer_response
    p: Add the requester's LUNAME to the SYSIBM.LUNAMES table at the server. If the remote LU is
    p > span: Db2
    p: , the requester's LUNAME is the label name, as opposed to the ACBNAME keyword, on the
    p > span: Db2
    p: VTAM APPL statement for the requester site. A server's SYSIBM.LUNAMES table should contain an entry for the requester's LUNAME.
    p: In the absence of a SYSIBM.LUNAMES row that specifically identifies the remote LU, a default SYSIBM.LUNAMES row (blank LUNAME) might be used, if defined, in the case where the inbound connection is through DRDA protocols. This default row might not reflect the needed inbound security characteristics, in which case a SYSIBM.LUNAMES row can be defined that explicitly identifies the remote LU.
    p: If the remote LU is a member of a remote sysplex and the local system requires access to the remote sysplex, then members of the remote sysplex to be accessed must be defined in the local SYSIBM.LULIST table. In this case, the remote sysplex LU can be defined in the local SYSIBM.LULIST table. A SYSIBM.LUNAMES definition, default row or explicit definition, is appropriate in cases where it is undesirable to define the remote LU in SYSIBM.LULIST, such as when you do not want the remote LU to be a candidate member when outbound accessing the remote SYSPLEX location.
    p: Verify that the condition did not occur because of the unintended use of a generic LU name, which would make
    p > span: Db2
    p: aware of a partner LU name (its generic LU name) that is not specified in the LUNAME column of the SYSIBM.LULIST or SYSIBM.LUNAMES tables. Look for evidence of a

    p: invokes RACF to extract a PassTicket for the partner site. However, RACF could not provide a PassTicket, and the attempt failed.
system_action
    p: The attempt to access the remote database resource failed, and the failure is reported to the application.

system_programmer_response
    p: The error usually occurs due to incorrect or missing RACF definitions. To avoid this error, specify the proper RACF definitions to provide for the PassTicket. Alternatively, you may avoid the use of PassTickets by changing the SECURITY_OUT column of the SYSIBM.IPNAMES and/or SYSIBM.LUNAMES CDB table for the partner site.

system_programmer_response
    p: Determine the failing application program and consider the following resolutions:

    ul > li > p > span > span: n
    ul > li > p > span: rows
    ul > li > p: , either in the application or in a stored procedure, this indicates an application intent to fetch all

    ul > li > p > var: n
    ul > li > p: rows. In this case, the cursor definition can be changed to reduce the value of
    ul > li > p > var: n
    ul > li > p: , or the application logic can be modified to fetch all
    ul > li > p > var: n
    ul > li > p: rows or to close the cursor before executing the statement that caused the in-transit data to be buffered.

    p: The distributed relational data system (DRDS) subcomponent detected an error while processing a DDM CNTQRY command received from a remote requester.
    p: A previous CNTQRY command specified a QRYROWSET parameter, which indicated the number of rows to be returned as a rowset. Because of the blocking limits in effect with the requester, only a partial rowset was returned to the requester. Some rows in the requested rowset are still unfetched and are pending. The DRDA rules require that this subsequent CNTQRY command must either:
    ul > li: Specify a QRYROWSET value that is equal to the number of pending rows in the rowset.
    ul > li: Reset the query blocks from the pending rowset
    p: The CNTQRY command did not specify the QRYRSTBLK parameter to reset the query blocks, so this command is assumed to completes the pending rowset. Because the requested QRYROWSET value does not equal the number of pending rows in the rowset that was requested by the previous CNTQRY, a DRDA exception occurred.

    p: The distributed relational data system (DRDS) subcomponent detected an error while processing a DDM CNTQRY command received from a remote requester. A previous CNTQRY command specified a QRYROWSET parameter, indicating the number of rows to be returned as a rowset. Because of the blocking limits in effect with the requester, only a partial rowset was returned to the requester and a number of rows in the requested rowset are still unfetched, and remain in pending state. The DRDA rules require that this subsequent CNTQRY command either reset the pending query blocks by means of the QRYRSTBLK parameter or must explicitly or implicitly specify a FETCH NEXT orientation (RELATIVE+1) to complete the pending rowset.The CNTQRY command did not reset the pending rowset and did not specify the FETCH NEXT orientation, resulting in a DRDA exception.

    p > span: Db2®
    p: has discovered the preexistence of a data set that has the same name as one it was about to create. The name of the data set appears in the SQLCA or in messages DSNP002I or DSNP022I.

    p > span > span > span > span > a: Collecting diagnostic data
    p > span > span > span: .
    p: This may occur if a user creates a data set with VSAM access method services (intending to use it for a table space or index), then creates the table space or index via SQL CREATE statement, but forgets to specify USING VCAT.
    p: Another possibility is that the data set remained from some prior, unsuccessfully completed DROP or DELETEor backout operation of
    p > span: Db2
    p: . This failure would probably occur if the data set or integrated catalog facility (ICF) catalog were unavailable at the time of the DROP or DELETE or backout. For example, packs may be offline, or other operational problems may exist. In this case, the table space would be dropped, but the data sets could remain and be brought back online at a later time.
    p: There should have been some indication of this type of failure at the time it occurred. (for example, some DSNP-prefixed message indicating the data set was not deleted). You might check recent console sheets for such a message; however, it may have happened a long time ago.
system_action
    p: Error indication is returned to the user.
operator_response
system_programmer_response
    p: Notify the database administrator if appropriate. Otherwise, either use access method services to delete the data set or use a different name for the table or index you are trying to create.
    p: If the data set name is correct, is cataloged, and appears in the VTOC, run the access method services DIAGNOSE command against the integrated catalog facility (ICF) catalog identified by the first qualifier of the data set name.
problem_determination
    p: Information is needed concerning the history of the use of this data set; that is, of the table space/index name in conjunction with this database name. Listings of the console, integrated catalog facility (ICF) catalog, and VTOC may also be needed, with details of the request that resulted in this code, and contents of the SQLCA. Also obtain operator's console sheet showing related messages, if any. Use this documentation to determine the cause of the problem.

If space cannot be found, then the data manager component will issue reason code 00C9009C for a partitioned page set or 00C9009D for a non-partitioned page set.

Define another table space, unload this one, then reload the tables into the separate spaces. (Be aware that this is a very large amount of data to move. Careful planning is recommended.)

    p: During the process of re-enabling data sharing, all members, other than the surviving member, are forced to cold start.

This record could not have been in the BSDS when data sharing was disabled, and this

    p: During restart, it was determined that at least one unit of recovery (UR) was still active at the previous termination of this

    p: subsystem and that the subsystem was last started at a different release level.
    p: During migration to a new release or fallback to an older release, all activity must be quiesced and there should be no active units of recovery.
    p > span: Db2
    p: restart will fail until the situation is resolved.
system_action
    p: The restart terminates abnormally, which terminates the subsystem. This action is to prevent the loss or incorrect processing of a
    p > span: Db2

operator_response
    p: Do not attempt to restart
    p > span: Db2
    p: until the error is resolved. Notify the system programmer and collect the required items for problem determination.
system_programmer_response
    p: Because all work must be quiesced before either migration or fallback of a
    p > span: Db2
    p: subsystem, the recommended action is to restart the
    p > span: Db2
    p: subsystem at the release level that created the outstanding unit or units of recovery and let the units of recovery end normally.
    p: You might need to use the RECOVER INDOUBT command to resolve indoubt threads.
    p: After all units of recovery have completed processing, use the STOP
    p > span: DB2
    p: command with MODE(QUIESCE) to stop
    p > span: Db2
    p: . Then restart
    p > span: Db2
    p: at the desired release level. Using a different release level may require additional migration or fallback actions.
    p: If it is not possible to restart
    p > span: Db2
    p: at the release level that created the outstanding units of recovery, then a cold start is required.
    ol > li: Print the BSDS using the DSNJU004 (print log map) utility.

The RBA value must be an even multiple of 4096 (a hexadecimal value ending in 000) and should be rounded up from the highest written RBA as indicated by the DSNJU004 output.

    p: An I/O error was encountered on a required OS/VS data set. An abend was issued to place the utility in a stopped state for review and correction. Resubmit the utility.
    p: This abend might also be issued by a utility that uses subtasks, if one subtask encounters an abend B37, D37, or E37 on a data set, and another subtask tries to write to the data set.
system_action
    p: One of two utility error messages (
    p > span: DSNU032E
    p: or
    p > span: DSNU040I
    p: ) is sent to the data set or device associated with the SYSPRINT DD statement of the utility job step. The error message identifies the error and the data set in error.
    p: If the abend is issued by utility subtasks,
    p > span: DSNU016I
    p: is issued instead of
    p > span: DSNU032E

system_programmer_response
problem_determination
    p: Problem determination depends upon which error message was directed to the data set/device identified by the SYSPRINT DD statement.
    p: If
    p > span: DSNU032E
    p: was issued, an I/O error was encountered on a required utility work data set. The message describes the error and the data set in error.
    p: If
    p > span: DSNU040I
    p: was issued, an error has occurred during BSAM access to the data set defined by the DD statement specified in the message. The DECB provided as a hexadecimal string contains the ECB in the first four bytes. The first byte of the ECB contains status bits that indicate the cause of the error.
    p: There might be an IOS (I/O subsystem) message on the MVS™ console SYSLOG indicating the type of I/O error that occurred. If an IOS message was issued, follow the problem determination directions for the message. Refer to the appropriate MVS publication for the meaning of the status bits.

user_response
    p: If the utility message was

    p: , the job can be restarted if an undamaged output data set is provided. Obtain an undamaged output data set, and restart the utility job step with the RESTART(PHASE) option. The job cannot be restarted if an unload data set, during the RELOAD phase of either the LOAD or REORG, is used as input instead of output.
    p: If the utility message was
    p > span: DSNU040I
    p: , determine the problem as described in Problem Determination. Then either resubmit the utility job using the RESTART option, or terminate the utility job step.
    p: If the utility message was
    p > span: DSNU016I
    p: , determine the cause of the B37, D37, or E37 abend and take the appropriate action. Normally, you will need to either allocate more storage for the data set, or change the allocation to a volume that has more space available.

explanation
    p: For the area (table space or partition) being reorganized, REORG with SHRLEVEL REFERENCE or CHANGE unloads data from the original data sets and reloads data into shadow data sets. REORG then exchanges the names of the original and shadow data sets, using temporary names during the renaming.
    p: The original name of a data set is in the form
    p > samp: catname.DSNDBx.dbname.psname. I0001.Annn
    p: . The shadow name of a data set is in the form
    p > samp: catname.DSNDBx.dbname.psname. S0001.Annn
    p: . The temporary name of a data set is in the form
    p > samp: catname.DSNDBx.dbname.psname. T0001.Annn
    p: . REORG uses such data sets for indexes as well as data.
    div: To exchange the names of the original and shadow data sets, REORG performs the following renaming:
    div > dl > dt: 1
    div > dl > dd: In the switch phase, it renames the original data set from the original name to the temporary name
    div > dl > dt: 2
    div > dl > dd: In the switch phase, it renames the shadow data set from the shadow name to the original name
    div > dl > dt: 3
    div > dl > dd: In the utilterm phase, it renames the original data set from the temporary name to the shadow name (for user-managed data sets). It deletes the temporary for
    div > dl > dd > span: Db2®
    div > dl > dd: -managed data sets.
    div: If a -TERM UTILITY is issued after any renaming, the -TERM UTILITY undoes the renaming that the REORG performed by renaming:
    div > dl > dt: 4
    div > dl > dd: The original data set from the shadow name to the temporary name
    div > dl > dt: 5
    div > dl > dd: The shadow data set from the original name to the shadow name
    div > dl > dt: 6
    div > dl > dd: The original data set from the temporary name to the original name
    p: During REORG, or during -TERM UTILITY, an attempt to rename a data set failed due to a system problem. This error condition can arise for a
    p > span: Db2
    p: -managed or user-managed data set.
    p: Message DSNP027I also appears, with the old and new names of the data set and with other information.

At the time of the request, the RAL had the RAL suppress (RALSUPPR) flag on, and the function vector list entry (FVLE) that was accessed (through FRBFVLE) did not have FVLEBIT0 on. This is not allowed. That is, the FVLE function is not allowed during RAL suppress.

explanation
    p: This abend code is issued during recovery processing for the suspend function when executing in SRB mode under the recovery routine established by the MVS™ SRBSTAT(SAVE) service. Because the recovery routine established by this service is the only routine in the FRR stack at the time of error, normal RTM percolation to the invoking resource manager recovery routine is not possible.
    p: After recovery processing for the initial mainline error has successfully completed, the RTM environment is exited through retry to a routine that restores the original FRR stack. This routine then issues an '04E' abend with this reason code. This causes entry into the original recovery routine established during suspend initialization.
system_action
    p: After this abend is intercepted by the original suspend recovery routine, a SYS1.LOGREC entry and
    p > span: Db2®
    p: SVC dump are requested to document the original error. The original recovery reason code is placed in the SDWACOMU field of the SDWA indicating the actions performed during recovery processing of the initial error.

explanation
    p: An error was detected in the command that was used to start the
    p > span: Db2®
    p: subsystem. There are two conditions that can cause this error. If the -START
    p > span: DB2
    p: command is in error, this abend results.
    p: Secondly, if the
    p > span: Db2
    p: subsystem is not running (had never been started, or had been stopped), any
    p > span: Db2
    p: command that is entered is interpreted as being a -START
    p > span: DB2
    p: command. In this second case, the subsystem starts just long enough to discover that the command actually is not a -START
    p > span: DB2
    p: command and then issues the abend.
system_action
    p: The
